# "Patch notes"

## 9th March 2023: Grandmaster clues, pinned presets, qol

* Slayer masks no longer have to be equipped for the kills to be tracked, they can be in your bank
* The `/data` slayer masks stat no longer requires being a patron to check
* You can now pin gear presets to your button menu by editing/creating a gear preset with a `pinned_setup`
* You can now pin trips/activities to your button menu by using `/config user pin_trip`, so any of your past trips can be repeated easily by clicking a button.
* @Cyr : Fixed solo TOB
* **Lottery** It's been a LONG time since we've done a normal, plain-old lottery - so we're running one starting today. How it works is, you put in lots of items, get tickets, and then have a chance of winning from the big pot at the end. The lottery command will show you the information, make sure to read it before adding in items. It will run for around a month, and there'll be 4 winners (can win more than once) receiving an equal split. `/lottery`
* **Grandmaster clue changes**
  * Now require 250 QP, 90+ in all skills, 300 Easy clues, 250 Medium clues, 200 Hard clues, 150 Elite clues, 100 Master clues (these are checked as 'actual' clue completions, so the clue has to be received as a drop, completed, and opened, all by you).
  * Added new cosmetics to GM: Ring of cabbage, Sack of mystery boxes, Queens guard outfit, Prisoner top/legs, Fox tail/ears.
  * The droprate of XP lamps in GMs has been **buffed** from 1 in 50 to 1 in 47.
  * The weighting of clues in GMs (not the droprate) has been changed so the lower clue tiers (e.g. beginner, easy) are slightly more common than the higher tiers (master). The same amount of clues are received as drops, but you're generally just less likely to receive a master clue.
  * The cosmetics table droprate was reduced from 1 in 20 to 1 in 50
* New dynamic farming bank background 'Farmer Jane'. This will change when your farming contract is ready.\
