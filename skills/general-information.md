# General Information

All xp in BSO is granted a 5x boost from OSB/OSRS rates.

### Global Boosts

There are five extremely rare items called [First Age](../custom-items/equippables.md#first-age) that each boost all xp gains by 1% with an additional 1% added if you have all 5 equipped.

Having a [master cape](../custom-items/equippables.md#master-capes) equipped anywhere will give a global 3% boost to all xp gained. This goes up to 8% when training the skill you have mastery in.

A community spreadsheet, available [`here`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMaCkbzR2TV9QVoRub74btXCc8Cw1coVff7VXUxvYkE/htmlview)`, shows all the best exp rates of each skill. You are also able to enter your own exp and see the time left to reach various xp milestones.`&#x20;
